Åu[v]Are you okay, Haruka? It didn't look like you felt good earlier...[/v]Åv[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[text]After reaching its climax, the event ended without incident, and the three of us walked home from school.[KeyWait]

ÅyHarukaÅz[CR]
Åu[v]It's okay, I'm feeling perfectly fine now. More importantly, is your ankle okay, Kimino?[/v]Åv[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[text]The incident with the strange water had made me pee in the pool, but after that, the water disappeared as if it'd never even been there.[KeyWait]

ÅyHarukaÅz[CR]
Åi[v]Saying that I came and peed during the interview would be too embarrassing...[/v]Åj[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[text]I used the excuse that I was just worn out from the competition.[KeyWait]
[text]I was more worried about Kimino's ankle, which she'd twisted in an attempt to not fall off her horses.[KeyWait]

Åu[v]Does it still hurt? Sensei offered to drive you home, so you shouldn't force yourself...[/v]Åv[KeyWait]

Åu[v]I'm okay, I'm okay. It's no big deal, and I had it treated already anyway. If anything, I'd be more worried in the hands of Tamachan-sensei's driving.[/v]Åv[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[text]Despite saying she was okay, Kimino was dragging her foot as she walked.[KeyWait]

ÅyHarukaÅz[CR]
Åu[v]You've always pushed yourself too hard, Kimino... Remember when you twisted your ankle on the jungle gym when you we were kids? Then, Yume and I walked you home just like we're doing now...[/v]Åv[KeyWait]

Åu[v]Huh? What do you mean, "always"...?[/v]Åv[KeyWait]

ÅyKiminoÅz[CR]
Åu[v]W-Why do you know that, Haruka...?[/v]Åv[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[Voice storage="a1084" buf=2]
ÅyHarukaÅz[CR]
Åu[v]...I mean, that's what Ryou told me a while back...[/v]Åv[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[Face storage="f_a051"]
[Voice storage="a1085" buf=2]
ÅyHarukaÅz[CR]
Åi[v]C-Crap... I keep relaxing and going back to normal when I'm around Yume and Kimino... R-Right now, I'm Haruka, Ryou's twin sister who lived apart from him![/v]Åj[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[Face storage="f_c023"]
[Voice storage="c0076" buf=2]
ÅyKiminoÅz[CR]
Åu[v]D-Damnit, Ryou! I can't believe he'd tell you that much about me! I wasn't [ita]that[endita] reckless as a kid, okay!?[/v]Åv[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[text]Kimino tried to save face, but for whatever reason, she was blushing and pouting.[KeyWait]

ÅyYumeÅz[CR]
Åu[v]You two talk a lot, huh? I didn't even know about you thanks to your family stuff... I never saw you at Ryou-chan's house... He never even told me about you...[/v]Åv[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[text]Yume began pouting too, sounding dejected.[KeyWait]

[Face storage="f_c022"]
[Voice storage="c0077" buf=2]
ÅyKiminoÅz[CR]
Åu[v]W-What else did Ryou say about me!? N-Nothing good, I'm sure... Ugh, I can't believe him![/v]Åv[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[text]I got the feeling that if I kept talking, I'd be in for a beating when I turned back into a guy.[KeyWait]

[Face storage="f_a034"]
[Voice storage="a1086" buf=2]
ÅyHarukaÅz[CR]
Åu[v]Ah, um... I don't talk to him [ita]that[endita] often... He just kind of mentioned it once... Um, mind if we stop and get some juice? I'm kind of thirsty.[/v]Åv[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[text]I'd give myself away if I said too much, so I changed the subject.[KeyWait]

Åu[v]Now that you mention it, they're selling a new kind of candy today. ÅÙ Let's get some and have it together![/v]Åv[KeyWait]
[FaceOff]

[text]Yume's eyes were twinkling. She loved sweets.[KeyWait]
[text]She began trotting toward a nearby convenience store.[KeyWait]
